            <h1>Hi, I'm Chris Lipinski</h1>
            <p>Iâ€™m the founder of trip.cards, a travel focused website where I put to practice what I have learnt during my time working in the travel technology sector.  I currently work at Zizoo where our mission is to digitize the nautical industry.  Previous to Zizoo I spent 8 years with Rome2rio where we helped people discover how to get anywhere by plane, train, bus, ferry & car.  
        In addition to my travel tech career, I also run a pop up bookshop in Melbourne Australia and help on various web related projects for clients and teams.</p>
