            <p>Learning a new skill is painful.  At first you are terrible at whatever you are trying to do.</p>
            <p>Looking for examples on how to improve only highlights how bad your current skill level is and how far you are away from competency.</p>
            <p>Never the less it's best to persist.</p>
            <p>You may never reach competency, but with each step and fumble, if you pick yourself up you will have learnt a new lesson at each attempt.</p>
