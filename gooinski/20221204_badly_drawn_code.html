            <h1>Badly Drawn Code</h1>
            <h2>A short journey on learning to code</h2>
            <h3>Author: Chris Lipinski, Published: 20221204</h3>
            <p>My love of computers began at a very young age. I have faint memories of visitng family aquintances and being exposed to C64 frogger, pong. Apple II Taipan.</p>
            <p>In the late 80's I managed to pester my parents into buying me a second hand IBM XT compatible PC.  I didn't know it at the time or not even sure if it is true, but editing and hacking game config files and system settings were my first forays into code.</p>
            <p>Throughout my childhood and working life my curiosity and interest with all computers have to offer has not waned.</p>
            <p>It is suprising to me that I never dived into coding up until recently.  The percpition that knowing how to code required extensive advanced mathimatical knowledge seems absurd now that I have spent the last year diving into learning software development.</p>
            <p>I feel I am finally making steady progress after initially floundering in tutorial mode.  I am starting to strikeout and working on using code to solve work related problems and using my nascent coding skills to attempt personal projects.</p>
            <p>The code is far from elegant or even effective, but I am making steady progress learning and reinforcing key concepts at every mistep and refactor.</p>
