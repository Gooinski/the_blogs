            <p>I've recently discovered <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com/" target="_blank">Lenny's Podcast</a> so far every guest and interview has been a wealth of knowledge for those working in tech and striving to build great product.</p>
            <p>In particular the episode with <a href="https://www.lennyspodcast.com/what-it-takes-to-become-a-top-1-pm-ian-mcallister-uber-amazon-airbnb/" target="_blank">Ian McAllister</a> struck a chord and opened my eyes on how little I think I know makes a good Product Manager.</p>
            <p>It's reinforced my belief that to grow and learn you need to be able to be vulnerable and open to learning new concepts and skills throughout your career and life in general.</p>
            <p>Every day is certainly a lesson and the more open you can be to learning the more you will grow.</p>
