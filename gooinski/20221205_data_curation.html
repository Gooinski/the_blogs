            <h2>Biting off more than you can swallow</h2>

            <p>When it comes to managing large sets of content/data it's important to think like a reptile.  Articulate that jaw to swallow more than you can chew.</p>
            <p>Large data sets need to managed with prioritisation to make sure the impactful 20% of content/data that genearates 80% engagement is over optimised while the remaining 80% is triaged to be 'reliable'.</p>
            <p>'Reliable can mean having sanity/validity checks and logic programitically drop bad data'</p>
            <p>Doing more with less by prioritising management of important subsets of data while doing the 'minumum' quality checks on the remainder can be a succesful stragegy in content and data curation.</p>
