    <h2>Improvement through repatition.</h2>

    <p>Daily habits lead to improvement by repatition.  I believe making time and finding reinforcing conditions and enviroments helps in forming better habit.</p>
    <p>Start by doing small actions that gravitate to a habit you are trying to achieve goes along way to success rather than over thinking and delaying action.</p>
    <p>Once you have completed something you feel has contributed to your desired goal step back. If you have more to do towards a postive habit it is a good idea to leave a desire to do more for the next day. It will help orientate you towards progressive success</p>
